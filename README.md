# WaterAmerica
On this project we are adding a feature that user can be able to go on the WA utility website and add the date and the address they moving to . In the logical part of our backend we used USPS api for address validation and date validation. Once the date arrived our backend update the database for user address in profile as well. There is also options available to edit the address and remove the moving info as well.
