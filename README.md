# WaterAmerica
On this project we are adding a feature that user can be able to go on the WA utility website and add the date and the address they moving to . In the logical part of our backend we used USPS API for address validation and date validation. On due date logical part of the backend will update the user address in DB. There is also options available to edit the address and remove the moving info as well.
